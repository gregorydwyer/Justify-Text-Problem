# Justify Text Problem
The purpose of this program is to take a paragraph of input as a single string and separate it into left and right justified lines. Then return those lines as an array of strings.
If a string is too long for a line, the program informs the user and terminates the run.

## Command Line Syntax
justifytext.java "user text here" "(integer for page width)"
